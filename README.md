# Web-Scraping and Data Analysis
Mission to Mars - data collection. In this project I extracted information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.


## **Data Collection Challenge**

For this assignment, I have been asked to:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html);

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html).
